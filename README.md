👋 Hi, I’m @BenjaminZK

👀 Passionate about JavaScript development and software engineering,
I love solving complex problems and building efficient, scalable applications.

🌱 Currently, I’m pursuing my studies at the Faculty of Science and Technology of Toamasina, majoring in Software Engineering. 
I have a solid foundation in C, C++, Java, PHP, and JavaScript.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative web development projects, open-source contributions,
and anything that pushes the limits of technology.

📫 You can reach me at benjaminzoukou@gmail.com.
Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
